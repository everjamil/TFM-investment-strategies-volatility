## Abstract
This Master's Final Project analyzes how market volatility influences investment strategies in developed markets, focusing on stock indices (S&P 500, Euro Stoxx 50, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225), safe-haven assets (gold and U.S. and German government bonds), and strategic assets (Brent crude oil) during the period 2007-2025.

The study collects and processes daily price and volatility data, mainly from the VIX index, applying quantitative and graphical time series analysis to compare the behavior of these assets before, during, and after high volatility episodes (2008 crisis, European debt crisis 2011, flash crash 2015, 2018 correction, COVID-19 2020, 2025 tensions).

The software tool used is Python, with scripts that automate event selection, return calculation, application of moving averages, and generation of visualizations to identify patterns such as flight to quality.

This analysis helps to understand how portfolios are reconfigured in contexts of uncertainty, detecting early signals (such as drops in Brent or spikes in the VIX) that allow anticipating rotations toward defensive assets.

The main objective is to assess to what extent and in what way volatility influences asset allocation and investment strategies, providing empirical evidence and practical recommendations.

The study is especially valuable for portfolio managers, institutional investors, financial analysts, and risk consultants, as it offers criteria and tools to adapt allocation strategies in high volatility scenarios.
